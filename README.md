# Product-of-N-numbers-after-X

Approach: Product of N Numbers After X

Read two integers as input: X and N.

Initialize a variable product to 1. This variable will be used to calculate the product of N numbers after X.

Use a loop to iterate from X + 1 to X + N (inclusive) for each number i in this range.

For each iteration:

Multiply the current value of product by i and update the value of product.

After the loop completes, the product variable will contain the result, which is the product of N numbers after X.

Print the value of product as the output.
